# Wireframe
One (or a few) simple sketch of how the user interacts with the application. 
This could be a sketch of your user interface. 
You can draw it with hand and insert it here as an image.

# Iteration Backlog
List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.

# Tasks
A tentative list of the "to do" in order to sucessfully complete this iteration. 
This list will change and it is good to keep it updated. 
It does not need to be exhustive.
